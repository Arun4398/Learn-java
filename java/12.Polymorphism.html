    <h1>POLYMORPHISM:</h1>

    <P>poly     --> many<br/>
    morphism --> forms</P>

<p>=>one entity showing different behaveiour at different place or state is called as polymorphism.<br/><br/>

=>Polymorphism is two types:</p>

<blockquote style="color: black;">1.Complietime polymorphism.<br/>
2.Runtime polymorphism.</blockquote>

<h2>Complietime Polymorphism:</h2>
    
    <p>=>Binding the method decleration to method definition by the Compiler at the Complie time based on the
        arguments is called as Complie Time Polymorphism.<br/><br/>

    =>since binding is done before the execution it is called as early binding.<br/><br/>

    =>Once the Binding is done it cannot be changed at the run time and hence it also called as static Binding.<br/><br/>

    =>Method Overloading is the best example of Complie Time Polymorphism.</p>

<h2>Runtime Polymorphism:</h2>
    
    <p>=>Binding the method decleration to method definition by the Jvm at the Run time based on the
        OBjects is called as Runtime Polymorphism.<br/><br/>
    
    =>since binding is done during the execution it is called as late binding.<br/><br/>

    =>Once the Binding is done it can be changed at the run time and hence it also called as Dynamic Binding.<br/><br/>

    =>Method Overriding is the best example of Complie Time Polymorphism.</p>
    <blockquote>eg:<br/>
        <blockquote>1.Binding<br/><img src="Image/dia20.png" width="800px" height="auto"><br/>
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arun4398/java/master/Polymorphism/RuntimePolymorphism.java"target="_blank">2.RuntimePolymorphism.java</a></blockquote></blockquote>
    <hr/>

<h1>GOLDEN RULE OF JAVA</h1>
    
    <p style="color: green;">=> using Upcasted reference if you call an Overriden method then you always get the implimentation of subclass.</p>
