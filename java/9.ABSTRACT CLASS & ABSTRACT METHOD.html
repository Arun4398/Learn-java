        <h1>ABSTRACT CLASS & ABSTRACT METHOD</h1>
		
		<p>=> A method which has only method Decleration and no method Definiton is called Abstract method.<br/><br/>

		=>Abstract method must be declerad by using abstract Keyword.<br/><br/>

		=>If a class contains aleast one abstract method,then the class must be declerad as abstract class.<br/><br/>

		=>it is Imposible to create a Object of abstract class.<br/><br/>
        
		=>we can Create a Reference variable of abstract class.<br/><br/></p>

		<P style="color:darkgreen"><=>If a class inherite from an abstract class then the subclass must Override the all the abstract method <br/>
		present in the superclass else the subclass must be declerad as abstract class. <br/></P>
        
        <p>=>final, private and static methods cannot be Overriden, So abstract method cannot be declerad as final,private,static<br/><br/>

        => within the abstract class</p>
        	<blockquote style="color: black;">-> only Abstract methods or <br/>
        	-> only Concrete methods or<br/>
        	-> both Abstract and Concrete methods.</blockquote>

        <p>=>Non-static Non-private members of abstract class can be Accessed by Createing Object of it sub class<br/><br/>

        =>Static non-private member of abstract class can be accessed by classname.membername;.<br/><br/>

        =>if Generalized method of all the subclass have Different Definition then those methods should be declared as <br/>
        Abstract method in generalized class. <br/><br/>

        =>By useing abstarct class we can ensure there are no missing method implimentatioms in the sub class.<br/><br/>

        =>abstract class acts a blueprint to create the concrete class.<br/></p>

 <h2>CONCRETE METHOD & CONCRETE CLASS:[Normal Method]</h2>

 		<p>=>A method which has a both method Decleration and Definitaion is called concrete method.<br/><br/>

 		=>if class contains only concrete method then the class called as concrete class.<br/><br/>

 		=>if Generalized method of all the subclass have Same Definition then those methods should be declared as <br/>
 		 	Concrete method in generalized class.</p>
